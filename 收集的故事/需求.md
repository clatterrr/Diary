=========Startup CEO A Field Guide to Scaling Up Your Business, + Website by Matt Blumberg (z-lib.org)

Some people say, “Give the customers what they want.” But that’s not my approach. Our job is to figure out what they’re going to want before they do. I think Henry Ford once said, “If I’d asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, ‘A faster horse!’” People don’t know what they want until you show it to them. That’s why I never rely on market research. Our task is to read things that are not yet on the page.

- What are the major problems your customers are facing today?
- What new products and services could you provide to address those problems?
- Are they looking for an upgrade to a current solution or something completely new?
- What would it be worth for them to solve this problem 
- (i.e., how much would they be willing to pay to solve it)?
