=================== Startup CEO A field guide to scaling up your business

- *Talk about failures*. At IronPort, we used to go through exhaustive postmortems—on everything from customer losses to engineering slips to misplaced strategies—and nothing helps make a leader more approachable than admitting their struggles, screw-ups, and behind-the-scenes thinking on hard calls. If leaders make this a priority, the whole company will be more open to learning from failure.

=================== Startup CEO A field guide to scaling up your business



It’s never hard to collect candidates to take credit for a success. Whenever something goes right, from a major fundraising deal to a good quarter or a big client win, lots of people will take credit—many of whom don’t deserve it. Fred Wilson has said it many times over to me: success has a thousand fathers. The flip side of that, though, is that failure is not an orphan.

Companies that have a culture of blame and denial eventually go down in flames. They are scary places to work. They foster in-fighting between departments and back-stabbing among friends. Most important, companies like that are never able to learn from their mistakes and failures to make sure those things don’t happen again.

Finger pointing and looking the other way as things go south have no place in a well-run organization. While companies don’t necessarily need to celebrate failures, they can create a culture where failures are treated as learning experiences and where claiming responsibility for a mistake is a sign of maturity and leadership. It starts at the top: if the boss is willing to step up and acknowledge a mistake, do a real postmortem and process the learnings with his or her team without fear of retribution, it sets an example that everyone in the organization can follow.

What separates A companies from B and C companies is the ability to recognize and process failures as well as successes. Far from being an orphan, failure usually has as many real fathers as success.
